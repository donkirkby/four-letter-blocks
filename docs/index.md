title: Four-Letter Blocks
subtitle: Crossword puzzles to assemble
---

This is a program for building a new type of puzzle I designed: a crossword
puzzle cut up into blocks of four letters. The solver gets the blocks plus a
set of standard crossword clues. Unfortunately, the clues aren't numbered in
the normal way - 1 Across might not be in the top left. To make up for that
nasty trick, every word has at least the first letter given.

To solve a puzzle: print out the PDF, cut out the blocks, and then use the clues
to put the blocks together. Here are a few ideas for how to make the blocks:
1. Printed on paper - easy to make, but frustrating to work with. Moving a piece
   or even breathing will probably move some other pieces around.
2. Printed on cardstock - a bit heavier and a bit less likely to move.
3. Printed on paper, glued to a cereal box - with a bit of thickness and more
   weight, the blocks move better and won't slide over each other.
4. Printed on cardstock, glued to felt - deluxe style. Slides very nicely and
   the blocks bump gently against each other.

Whatever technique you use, glue sticks are easier to work with than white glue.
